# AmneziWG-Go Binary Placeholder
# This is a placeholder for the actual AmneziWG-Go binary
# 
# The actual binary should be compiled from the AmneziWG-Go source
# and replace this placeholder during installation
#
# Binary will be architecture-specific:
# - ARMv7 (32-bit) for older routers
# - ARMv8/AArch64 (64-bit) for newer routers  
# - MIPS for some router models
#
# Install script should detect architecture and download appropriate binary
